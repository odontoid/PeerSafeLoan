PeerSafeLoan (PSL)

Peersafeloan network is a platform for the future of funding built on the Ethereum blockchain that acts as an escrow or runs as a blockchain based banking facility that allows users to lend and borrow funds.
The peersafeloan platform provides lend and borrow features. People will deposit their funds on our platform and lock them up and set a lend ratio, the borrowers will deposit security funds and borrow money. In the process, the peersafeloan platform will act as an escrow or middleman between the lender and the borrower with minimum amount of fees levied for our services.
